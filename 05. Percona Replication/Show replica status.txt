#SHOW REPLICA STATUS

SHOW REPLICA STATUS\G; on seconadary/replicas gives us an information about complete status how is the replication working.

We have two threads 
	1. IO Thread
	2. SQL Thread

1. IO Thread: 
	Ensures that it pulls the data from source based on source log file, and this thread works for checking as dedicated one. 
	
2. SQL Thread:
	Ensures that all the recorded events on the log which was brought by the IO thread changes are applied on databases. 
	
3.  When Read_Source_Log_Pos: and  Exec_Source_Log_Pos: number are equal it defines that no SQL events are more to apply to databases.

4.  Replica_IO_Running: Yes
    Replica_SQL_Running: Yes
	These ensures that replica is that threads are active and running or not, when we stop replica it might show us that as NO.
	
* Replica IO_THREAD:
--------------------

Demo to know how IO thread stops sending the data if we stop IO thread on Replica, 

> STOP REPLICA IO_THREAD;

you can validate that 
	1.  Replica_IO_State: 
		this will be empty 
	2.	IO thread will not bring and wait from/for source to send the events recorded in bin log. 
	
to check and start this again use the below command.

> START REPLICA IO_THREAD;

* Replica SQL_THREAD:
----------------------

Demo to know how SQL Read_Source_Log_Pos: and  Exec_Source_Log_Pos: will be affected without applying the changes even 
if we have IO thread working and no changes are able to be applied on the replica. 

> STOP REPLICA IO_THREAD;

> START REPLICA IO_THREAD;

* Ignore databases
-------------------

To ignore the database we can use or add the information in configuration file. 

In the my.cnf or if you have a seperate configuration for replication you can now ignore the databases. 

in mysql 
> STOP REPLICA;

exit mysql and then in 
> sudo vi /etc/mysql/replication.cnf 

> ignore-replicate-db		= 	finance;

> sudo systemctl stop mysql && sudo systemctl start mysql

in mysql 

> START REPLICA;

> SHOW REPLICA STATUS\G;
	This gives the information about the replication and you can check ignore db column in the output where it lists the database information. 

you can now check by creating any tables or objects and now no objects will be replicated to destination. 

* Ignore Tables
-----------------

To ignore the database tables we can use the below commands 

In the my.cnf or if you have a seperate configuration for replication you can now ignore the databases. 

in mysql 
> STOP REPLICA;

exit mysql and then in 
> sudo vi /etc/mysql/replication.cnf 

> ignore-replicate-table		= 	world.oceans;

> sudo systemctl stop mysql && sudo systemctl start mysql

in mysql 

> START REPLICA;

> SHOW REPLICA STATUS\G;
	This gives the information about the replication and you can check ignore table column in the output where it lists the ignored tables information. 

you can now check by inserting data into the table or objects and now no objects data will be replicated to destination.
