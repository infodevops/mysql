Q1. What networks ports are required for Percona Xtradb cluster and Galera?
Ans: 4567, 4568, 4444

Q2. What is AppArmor and why it will restrict the Percona Xtradb cluster installation or MySQL to run?
AppArmor is security module that restricts program capabilities using per program profiles.

When AppArmor is active:
It might block SST operations (e.g. xtrabackup trying to access certain files).

It may prevent MySQL from binding to Galera-related ports.

It can deny file or socket access needed for clustering.

sudo systemctl stop apparmor

sudo systemctl disable apparmor
